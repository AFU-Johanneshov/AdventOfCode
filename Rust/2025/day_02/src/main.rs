/*
Part One:

First step here is to read the string and convert it to a sequnce of number pairs.
Once that is done we can process each number in the range of the pair.

Processing could work like this:
Convert the number into a string.
Split the string in half. If both parts are the same then the ID is invalid.



Part Two:

Part two adds a quite annoying new requirement. Any id with a repeating pattern is invalid as long as it repeats at least once.
The first glance solution I can think of is to check each combination, which will be very slow.

Which would mean checking each pattern from the first digit to half of all digits.
So basically:
Take the first digit and iterate through the string. If at any point a different digit is found then move on to the next.
Take the first two digits and iterate through the string two steps at a time. If at any point the two digits checked doesn't
    match the first then continue to the next.
Repeat this up to the string length/2.
If any iterator completes without a mismatch then the id is invalid.
